Telegram Bot for Ethereum Gas Price Notification `@EthereumGasPriceNotifier_bot`

## Motivation

Sometime ago I created one service for getting notified about recommended Ethereum Gas Price changes. It's called `gasz : Ethereum Gas Price Notifier`.

You can use it @ https://gasz.in

It has Web Notification functionality & how it works is like ðŸ‘‡

- You subscribe to service, over Websocket transport, with a payload, which specifies when recommended Gas Price of certain category i.e. `{fast, fastest, average, safeLow}`, reaches certain threshold, you'll be notified
- And you'll receive one browser notification, when it happens

Also, you can write your own client, which subscribes programmatically & takes decisions.

But browsers sometimes behave unexpectedly

- Your websocket connection can get dropped for different reasons
- Connection management in `gasz` webUI is done using service workers, to reduce load on service
- It allows me to maintain single connection from single browser & you can subscribe multiple times over same transport
- But it shows some strange behaviour sometimes
- Also there're common cases like, you quiting browser window/ putting your machine into sleep
- In all these cases connection will get hampered & `gasz` doesn't remember who subscribed to what, one connection is lost. So reconnection is not so helpful. You have to subscribe again.

Due to all these problems, I thought of writing one Telegram Bot which will help me in easily notifying you about Ethereum Gas Price changes, when you subscribe to. You can also check what's current recommended gas price.
